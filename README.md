# Description

This repository contains the code and files from the three-session R workshop I developed to teach the basics of data wrangling, visualization, and analysis in R at The University of Akron in Spring 2018.

The R code files labelled "full" include the answers to the problem sets.

Datasets used for this workshop were obtained from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/) and [The World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report).
